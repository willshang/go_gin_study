### 特性

## 英文
-  **What is Gin?** 
``` 
Gin is a web framework written in Golang. 
It features a martini-like API with much better performance, up to 40 times faster. 
If you need performance and good productivity, you will love Gin. 
```
### 
- Fast
``` 
Radix tree based routing, small memory foot print. 
No reflection.
Predictable API performance.
```
- Middleware support
``` 
A incoming HTTP request can be handled by a chain of middlewares and the final action. 
For example: Logger, Authorization, GZIP and finally post a message in the DB.
```
- Crash-free
``` 
Gin can catch a panic occurred during a HTTP request and recover it. 
This way, your server will be always available. 
It’s also possible to report this panic to Sentry for example!
```
- JSON validation
``` 
Gin can parse and validate the JSON of a request, 
checking for example the existence of required values.
```
- Routes grouping
``` 
Organize your routes better. 
Authorization required vs non required, different API versions. 
In addition, the groups can be nested unlimitedly without degrading performance.
```
- Error management
``` 
Gin provides a convenient way to collect all the errors occurred during a HTTP request. 
Eventually, a middleware can write them to a log file, to a database and send them through the network.
```
- Rendering built-in
``` 
Gin provides a easy to use API for JSON, XML and HTML rendering.
```
- Extendable
``` 
Creating a new middleware is so easy, just check out the sample codes.
